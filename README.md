Coq Starter Skeleton — 2-of-3 multisig (abstracted EC model)
============================================================

What this project is
---------------------
This is a *starter* Coq project (scaffolding) intended to be handed to a formal verification
team. It models key derivation, signing, and a 2-of-3 multisig *spec* using **abstract
axioms** instead of a complete low-level formalization of secp256k1 or ECDSA math.

Files
-----
- src/AbstractEC.v       : Abstract types and axioms for keys, signatures, and verification.
- src/KeyDerivation.v    : Deterministic key derivation from a seed (abstract).
- src/MultiSigSpec.v     : Definition of multisig redeem predicate and a theorem (proved).
- README.md              : this file.
- LICENSE                : MIT license.
- build.sh               : simple helper script to compile the files with `coqc`.

How to use
----------
1. Install Coq (recommended >= 8.12). Use opam or your distro package manager.
   Example (opam):
     opam install coq
2. From terminal:
     cd /mnt/data/coq_multisig_starter
     bash build.sh
3. Theorem checking output will show which lemmas are proved.

Limitations / next steps
------------------------
- This skeleton uses axioms to abstract cryptographic primitives. For a production-grade
  formalization you will want to:
    * Import a verified finite-field and elliptic-curve library (or mechanize secp256k1).
    * Replace axioms with proved properties or link to verified libraries.
    * Provide extraction or concrete tests tying Coq specs to reference implementations.
- The provided theorem is a high-level proof of script satisfaction under the axioms;
  it is *not* a cryptographic reduction nor a substitute for a cryptanalysis/audit.

If you want, I can extend this skeleton to use existing Coq libraries (e.g. math-comp,
fiat-crypto, or project-specific EC formalizations) — tell me which you'd prefer.
